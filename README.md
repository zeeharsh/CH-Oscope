# ðŸ”¥ Chemical Reaction Simulator (CHâ‚‚O Breakdown)

This Python project simulates how a simple fuel molecule (CHâ‚‚O) breaks down into gases like Hâ‚‚, CO, and CHâ‚„ when heated from 1000K to 2500K. It uses the `gaspype` thermodynamics library and visualizes the results with a clean graph.

## ðŸ“ˆ What It Does


- Simulates chemical equilibrium using real NASA data
- Visualizes how gases change at different temperatures
- Helps understand real-world combustion (like in engines/rockets)

## ðŸ§ª Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Gaspype](https://github.com/DLR-Institute-of-Future-Fuels/gaspype)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chemical-reaction-simulator.git
cd chemical-reaction-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simulator.py
